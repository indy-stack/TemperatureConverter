# Temperature Converter
This is part of a tutorial that I followed online with some
persona;l touches like the UI.
# What I learned
During this tutorial I learned more about javascript functions
as well as more Dom manipulation like changing each temperature
every time a different value was entered. This was done by
calling a function when the input changed in this case
onchange ="computeTemperature(event)".
